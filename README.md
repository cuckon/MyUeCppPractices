# My UE & C++ Practices

## Winter

Inspired by https://github.com/SardineFish/raindrop-fx.

TODO:

- [x] Smear effect.
- [x] Trails of dripping drops.
- [x] Drops get merged when overlap.
- [x] Bugfix: Noncontinuous strokes when slow.
- [x] Growing size when dripping down.
- [x] Stretch effect.
- [ ] Sensitive to stylus pressure.
- [ ] Blured glass to create the defocus effect

And might be done if I get time:
- [ ] Grid based overlap detection.
- [ ] Transparency control of drops.
