# My UE & C++ Practices

## Winter

Inspired by https://github.com/SardineFish/raindrop-fx.

TODO:

- [x] Smear effect.
- [x] Trails of dripping drops.
- [ ] Drops get merged when overlap.
- [ ] Bugfix: Noncontinuous strokes when slow.
- [x] Growing size when dripping down.
- [ ] Stretch effect.

And might be done if I get time:
- [ ] Grid based overlap detection.
